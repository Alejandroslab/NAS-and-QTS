For the first installation
remember to connect your lan cable to the first plug

boot the NAS

follow the instructions
QTS will boot

in QTS open disk and storage

then create 'new storage pool'

A storage pool is a group of volumes that you can separate

volumes represents single parts of the disk

QNAP NAS will create RAID according to the number of disk you select
for the storage pool
The size of the disk will be trimmed (half of the space will be necessary for the RAID to work)

there will be also some space reserved for Snapshots



then there are several ways to design your NAS in terms of storage

remember just a few things:

Once you create a storage pool (and therefore a RAID, as it will create it automatically)
all the disk inside cannot be unmerged!
Therefore think twice about your final design in terms of RAID because there is no 'undo' button

After creating the pool you can create inside all the volumes you want!
Volumes can also be formatted (with the button 'Remove')

in the first Volume you will create QTS will create all the users folder,
home, homes and the other system folders.

You will be able to access them from your network!


you can also increase the size of the volumes accordingly to the total
size of the storage pool (just try not to get to the maximum size)
this could be necessary if you need more space and you see that
there is too much Unallocated space.

click on storage pools->volumes->manage

now click on Resize Volume

set your desired size

NEVER EXCEED THE SIZE OF THE ENTIRE STORAGE POOL

example

storage pool size: 3tb
volume 1: 1tb
volume 2: 1 tb

you can expand let's say the volume 1

volume 1: 1,5 tb
volume 2: 1 tb

but the total sum must not exceed the 3tb of storage pool or neither
get closer to the maximum size.
