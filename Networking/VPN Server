Use QVPN. Go to L2TP tab and just put 'enable'

Remember the Preshared Key!

go to mycloud link app on qnap configuration then activate the services.
You will see an IP that could be used as substitute of myqnapcloud.com domain (something like 93.29.. etc)

------------------
On the same QVPN window go to VPNClient->VPN Connection Profiles
Click Add->L2TP

On Server Address insert: 10.2.0.2 (don't insert myqnapcloud.com or it will not work. It should be internal IP)

Username and password: just use the ones that are the same of the user that you want to have access.

Leave authentiation as MS-CHAPv2.
Leave preshared key as QNAP or change it (you have to remember this).
Leave checked 'Reconnect when the VPN connection is lost'

Click apply

On the right side of the table thtat will appear click the clip icon that says 'Connect'

Now from your server you are done.

Go to your router and open the ports indicating the IP of the NAS.
(see forwarding ports)
------------------

LT2P PORTS:
UDP: 500, 1701, 4500

do not open port 8080!


------

You can then set the users tha can access to the vpn
VPN Server -> Privilege Settings

Click on 'Add VPN Users' and add the users


------


On the client

Create a new VPN connection



Set as server: â€¦..myqnapcloud.com or the public IP indicated in the app mycloudlink
(the public IP changes accordingly to the policies of your service provider)

Account: the user that has access to qnap
Password: the passowrd of that user

Secret (in iOS): put the Preshared Key ( QNAP is the defautl one)


you can also set google DNS 8.8.8.8 to get internet
sometimes the default dns may not work



You do not have to setup VPN connection profiles in VPN Client tabn in QVPN!
In fact if you set up with the same configurations of the VPN server. Internet on the clients (outside the local network) will not be available.

In that case full tunnel will not work (it will work only split tunneling though)
