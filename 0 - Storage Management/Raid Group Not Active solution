RAID Group 1 in dataVoldume is 'not active'" and I can't access my files.

This may happen if you extract your hd and the replug in, after clicking on 'Recovery'

you will get a live hd and also RAID group but will not be able to access to the files


the solution to this problem is only accessing via ssh to the machine and then run:

/etc/init.d/init_lvm.sh

if at the end of the process states 'Done' then your drive has been recovered.
Basically this will init the lvm 

It may happen that alert tresholds have been disabled to all the disks with this script
