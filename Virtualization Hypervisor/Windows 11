Unlike what has happened before, instead of the error you will jump to the dialog box window that shows the Windows 11 contract. We continue as follows:

    Accept the terms of the Windows 11 contract.
    Use the Custom option: Install Windows only (advanced) to continue.
    Create a new partition and select it to install Windows 11 on it.
    Finally, the installation process will start.
