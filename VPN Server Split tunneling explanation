You can use your server as Default Gateway
this means that all your traffic when
connected to the server will pass through
your server (your connected device will get the public
IP of your server)

this classic and default method is called 'full tunnel'

REMEMBER in the qnap nas vpn client and server cannnot
be turned on at the same time (they will not work
although there is not any limit to this. Is just
a decision of qnap)

in mac you have to set up full tunnelling

in your vpn setting click on advanced
and check 'Send all traffic'

using full tunnel you may want to set up

google dns (8.8.8.8)


SPLIT tunneling
to enable split tunneling in ios

uncheck 'Send all traffic'  in vpn setting
the same for mac


On windows you have to go on settings->network ->VPN-> change adapter options -> click right on the
vpn connection created Then
->Properties->Networking->Select 'IPV4'
->select Properties->
select Advanced->
e uncheck "Use default gateway on remote network" .

Confirm clicking ok

Now you will use for internet your own connection
having at the same time the possibilty to access
to all the resources of your remote network

REMEMBER split tunneling is not safe in unsafe connections like public wifi's
