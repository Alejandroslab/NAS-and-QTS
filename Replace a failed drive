QNAP NAS supports hot-swap

This means that when a disk fails just unplug it
without powering off the NAS.

when a disk fails RAID will pass to the status o 'deprecated'



It will beep and afterwards you can plug the new ones

Then the NAS will automatically rebuild the NAS.

if for some reason it will not start automatically you have to do it otherwise if
another disk will fail all the RAID array will break and you will lose data,
