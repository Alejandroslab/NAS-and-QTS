Never ever set 'Encryption'

even is not safe. it is happened in the past that after power failure
the disk could not be decrypted even if the password is correct!

therefore for your data safety leave it unencrypted!

Design and implement you backup strategy a<ccording to your usage!

this is really important

for RAID remmeber also to use disk with the same size
if in fact you have disks with different sizes, the RAID will be done on the
disk with less capacity leaving the bigger one with excessive space that
will not be availble in any way! therefore a waste of space (and also money)

Before doing any critical operation like, unmounting, hotswapping etc
be sure to have backups in place!
