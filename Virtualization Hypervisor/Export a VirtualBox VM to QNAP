First copy the folder that is located in

C:\\Users\MyUser\VirtualBoxVM

Inside the Guest OS folder you will find a .vbox file and a .vdmk file (much larger)

Open virtualization station
Select 'Import'>'Convert Image'

Select the .vdmk and a destination folder in which save the new image converted

Now you can just create a new machine and link the image converted as virtual hard drive.
This image will have extension .img

Boot the machine and done!

You may need to adjust some settings (video card most of the times)

REMEMBER! You do not need to uninstall the VirtualBox Guest additions
You do not need to set the same RAM and CPU size
If you have installed the VirtualBox Extension Pack (that is different from the Guest Additions) then it may not boot
