For the first installation
remember to connect your lan cable to the first plug

boot the NAS

follow the instructions
QTS will boot

in QTS open disk and storage

then create 'new storage pool'

then there are several ways to design your NAS in terms of storage

remember just a few things:

Once you create a storage pool (and therefore a RAID, as it will create it automatically)
all the disk inside cannot be unmerged!
Therefore think twice about your final design in terms of RAID because there is no 'undo' button

After creating the pool you can create inside all the volumes you want!
Volumes can also be formatted (with the button 'Remove')

in the first Volume you will create QTS will create all the users folder,
home, homes and the other system folders.

You will be able to access them from your network!
