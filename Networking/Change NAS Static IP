If you have set your IP as static in you router

you can change it from your router then you have to access to your NAS

with the previous address go to
'Network and Switch', click on 'Switch', click on the vertical 3 dots on your 'Virtual Switch' and click
on 'Renew Ip Address'

the NAS will prompt you with the IP set up in your router
click ok
done!

REMEMBER! you can set  your IP as static also in the NAS settings but this is not recommendable
because of order.
If you setup static ip locally then is better to setup your static ip locally on all your machine
but this is not a good idea because if you mix, that is set a machine with a static IP locally and
another in the router
then you can forget which of them has been set up locally and which of them has been
set up as static on your router

therefore it is better to centralize all your desired static ip in your router.

You will get a list with all the devices with the IP static set up.
