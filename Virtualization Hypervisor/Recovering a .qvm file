.qvm is the extension for the vm images of QNAP Nas

the .qvm image contains the images of the partitions.
 with 7zip you can extract the img files of the partitions.
 Using qemu-img you can then convert the partition in VMDK,
 and then you can build a new VMWare linux box
 and then mount inside the vmdk volume (that is not bootable).
