First go to myqnapcloud and then click on 'Access Control'
add an user indicating an e-mail

Rememeber that the user must register on the website myqnapcloud.com with the e-mail that you indicate in the settings 

And done!

After the user completes the registrations it will be linked to the QNAP NAS
Anyways to have access to the content they need to have credentials that you set up in 'Users' in the QNAP Settings 
Therefore they should have a local account in the NAS that will be used to have access to the content

To sum up:
the external user need to register with an email
He or she also must have a local account in the NAS that have to indicate inside myqnapcloud.com (user and password) to have access to the content

and done!
