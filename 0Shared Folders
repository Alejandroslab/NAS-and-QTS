REMEMBER! (for windows)
When you add a new user add it WITHOUT SPACES inside the like:

'Stephen Contoso'

could become

'Stephen.Contoso'


if it happens that an user has spaces inside its name probably you will not
be able to access to files within File Explorer unless you do not add:

'Stephen%SPACE%Contoso'

anyways if you set correct permissions to 'Network Services' it should work
even with spaces in the name

it will support dots.
If you access in File Explorer to network folders with a user
without saving it, you will need to reboot to clean the temporary user


_______________


In WIndows you can change or remove user authentication for network shares
in the 'Credential Manager'

you can find it in home typing 'Credential Manager'
____________

other thing to consider. as your organization complexity will expand
you could be not able to remember all the permissions given if you
have done that based on username

it is more straightforward to use groups in which adding usernames
from time to time!

you will find 'User groups' inside 'Privilege' in the 'Control Panel'

When creating a new user REMEMEBER! leave the permissions to use the 'Network Services'
or you will not be able to use the credentials in File Explorer in Windows
