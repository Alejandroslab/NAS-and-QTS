When you want to rename a Shared Folder be careful!

Remember to SPECIFY the path!
example:

Label: 'Volume Server'
current path: '\Volume Server'

if I want to rename it, I have to change both the label and the current path!

Label: 'My Volume'
new path: 'My Volume'

otherwise it will happen something like this:

Label: 'My Volume'
current path: '\Volume Server'

in this case 'My Volume' is just a renamed shortcut for the real folder
that is still 'Volume Server'
