Remember that NOT all NAS can perform virtualization

therefore check compatibilityy first!

if the virutalized machine has some keyboard issues just close and reopen the
window of the virtualized OS (very frequent problem at the momentg)

for example: cpu like Annpurna cannot peform virutalization.
Even if you add more ram Annapurna will not let you virtualize.
to virtualize you need intel cpus.

anywyas to get a copy of let's say windows

dowload virutalization app from qnap store

click on create vm

set data and ram

in cd image point to your .iso

hdd location is the location in which the system will be installed
(don't worry it will appear just another .iso file)

the app will also automatically add a virtual switch to get internet working

start the vm and install as in any other machine


in windows activate Remote deskotp from settings

now you can access from anywhere in your network to the VM inside the NAS
