Use L2TP Connection
you will be able to connect!

REMEMBER! you cannot set at the same time VPN Server and VPN Client (is a limitation by QNAP.. but technically it can be done)

REMEMBER!
When you connect to your vpn client in the local machine (that is a
VPN provider like ExpressVPN, NordVPN etc) you will not be able to access to NAS resources with the hostname
like calibre server

myserver:8080

in this case you will have to indicate the IP and not the host!
