You can eject disks any time
If they are failed just unplug them, wait 20 seconds to the hd to cool down
then eject it and replace it with the new one.

It wil beep twice and a red light will appear.

After you replace the HD it will restart to rebuild the RAID automatically
therefore you should not lose any data
