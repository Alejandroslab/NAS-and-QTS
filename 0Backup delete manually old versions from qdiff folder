if you have a .qdff backup and HBS cannot complete
backup because the disk is full you need to delete manually
some versions.
This happens when you set a number excessively high
of retained versions when your disk size is not that
huge.

The problem is that qdiff extension is not easy to understand
(to unecrypt it you have to use a tool from qnap)

anyways to free up some space if you wish to delete your
older version:

open File Station
open your external disk
then open 'dedup' folder and then open 'vault'

vault is the folder in which all your files are archived.

You have now to order it by modified date.

You can proceed to delete the oldest folders and free up space

HBS3 will then recognize the backup as usual and will complete
your new backup
