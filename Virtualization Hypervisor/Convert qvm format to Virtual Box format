You can convert your VM that in the QNAP environment has the .qvm extension
with the .ovf extension (that will allow you to import the machine in Virtualbox)


To do that first turn off the vm
Then inside your Overview view click on your desired VM and click on 'Export VM'

Then select .ovf format and uncheck 'Include ISO image' or 'Compress image'

then select the location and click Start

Now two files will be created the .ovf file that will be a very small file
and a .vdmk file that will be the bigger file

Then open virtual box click on import select the .ovf file and let it import.
It will create a copy of the vdmk file on the default path:

C:\\Users\MyUser\VirtualBox VMs
