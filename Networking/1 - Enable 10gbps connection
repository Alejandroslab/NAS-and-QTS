to enable 10gbps connection (to trasnfer at speed almost to 1-2 gbps between windows machiens)
you must first install (in windows) QNAP Guest Tools
just insert the virtual disk and install the program 
then shutdown the vm 

under the connection select the 10gbps adapter/switch and select as Physical Virtual Adapter 'VirtIO' 
now power on the vm and done!
to check speed use 'iperf3' with cmd (just download it point to the folder with cmd and done)

between windows machines speed never exceeds 2 gbps 

from a windows machine to a linux machine speed reach 4gbps.
