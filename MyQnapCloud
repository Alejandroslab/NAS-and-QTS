An easy way to share your files within your NAS to an external user is to use the myqnapcloud service

You have to activate it within the app

Then go to 'Accesso control' and add the e-mail of the external user

Click on 'Apply' (remember to click on Apply! otherwise it will not send any link)

The external user will receive an e-mail


He will have to sign up to myqnapcloud and then after signing in on the left side he will see your NAS under Friend's Device

If he clicks on the device he will then be asked an user and a password

In this case this user and this password are some user that has previously been created inside the NAS in Control Panel->Users

DONE!
