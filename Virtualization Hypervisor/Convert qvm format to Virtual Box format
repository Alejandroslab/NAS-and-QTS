You can convert your VM that in the QNAP environment has the .qvm extension
with the .ovf extension (that will allow you to import the machine in Virtualbox)


To do that first turn off the vm
Then inside your Overview view click on your desired VM and click on 'Export VM'

Then select .ovf format and uncheck 'Compress image'

Then leave checked 'Include ISO image'

then select the location and click Start

Now two files will be created: the .ovf file that will be a very small file
and a .vdmk file that will be the bigger file.

You can import in VirtualBox only the .ovf file that will look for the vdmk file
automatically

To do that open virtual box click on import select the .ovf file and let it import.
It does not matter if the .ovf is located on a newtork folder as the import
function will create a copy of the virtual machine on the default path:

C:\\Users\MyUser\VirtualBox VMs

More specifically it will create a copy of the .ovf file and the .vdmk file.

LAST STEP!
REMEMBER!
Before booting up the machine:
You have to go to settings>system >and check 'Enable I/O APIC'
This is valid if the machine that you want to import is a Windows machine

________
Enable Networking:

Go to settings->Network
on 'Advanced'
on 'Adapter Type' try to select a different adapter such as 'Intel PRO 1000'
otherwise with PCNet FAST it may not work
